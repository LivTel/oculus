Required binaries 
-----------------

On oculus these were all installed in /usr/local/
On newskycam, many seem to be mixed betwen /usr/ and /home/eng/indi instead

On oculus the camera drivers were installed from a third party repository using apt.
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mutlaqja/ppa
  sudo apt-get install kstars
  sudo apt-get install indi-full
On newskycam they were installed by IAS. I am not sure how or where from. Bug 2251 seems to
suggest indi was already on that machine and we are simply using the existing version. Not
sure how old that is.

Also need
  sudo apt-get install ntp
  sudo apt-get install ssh
  sudo apt-get install saods9
  sudo apt-get install nfs-common

On oculus
Edited /etc/rc.local to start server on boot as root:
	/usr/bin/indiserver -p 7264 /usr/sbin/indi_sx_ccd 
On newskycam
indiserver already started by ics autobooter, so /etc/rc.local not needed.

Previous versions of the data transfer script (ari_xfer_inst) used 'lockfile' which is part of procmail
but I do not want to install procmail just to get a lockfile handler. Instead the lockfile is
beind converted to use 'lockfile-create' and 'lockfile-check' which are ubuntu defaults.
